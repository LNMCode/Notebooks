## About android development

Android software development is the process by which applications are created for devices running the Android operating system. Google states that "Android apps can be written using Kotlin, Java, and C++ languages" using the Android software development kit (SDK), while using other languages is also possible. All non-Java virtual machine (JVM) languages, such as Go, JavaScript, C, C++ or assembly, need the help of JVM language code, that may be supplied by tools, likely with restricted API support. Some programming languages and tools allow cross-platform app support (i.e. for both Android and iOS). Third party tools, development environments, and language support have also continued to evolve and expand since the initial SDK was released in 2008. The official Android app distribution mechanism to end users is Google Play; it also allows staged gradual app release, as well as distribution of pre-release app versions to testers.

## Short description

Taking notes is one of the great ways to ensure that we can keep track of important thoughts or things from a meeting. Can easily manage and organize important notes for finding them in the future.

## Levels to be ensured in the project

- **Level 1**
The first requirement of a note-taking app is to be able to store notes. This is the simplest level to start with, where you need to organize your recorded notes and save them for later. Initialize a form to add a new note and see them in the list of notes.

- **Level 2**
To make it easier to find notes later, you want a way to manage your notes and an easy way to find them. So adding categories or tags is really great for creating a UI for finding notes.

 Added features to create tags or categories for notes and import to search for them.

- **Level 3**
Whether we realize it or not, we can find correlation patterns between different notes and find important points between notes, where we can see benefits of our network of notes. Add a Research-inpsired path of the notes to create a network of links between them.
